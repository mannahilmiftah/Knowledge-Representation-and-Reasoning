The project developed an automated Academic Degree Validation System using Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR). It models degree structures—core courses, domain/major requirements, electives, prerequisites, and credit rules—using formal representations in OWL/RDF and SPARQL for querying and validation. A reasoning engine evaluates a student’s completed courses and infers whether all graduation requirements are satisfied. The system identifies fulfilled and pending requirements, checks credit totals, validates prerequisites, and provides clear explanations of decisions. This approach reduces manual effort, eliminates errors, ensures transparency, and offers a flexible, scalable solution for academic institutions to verify degree completion efficiently and consistently.
